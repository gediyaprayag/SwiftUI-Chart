This demo app shows how to create complex Bar chart which has multiple bar markers. Something like below image.

As given in the image blue color is for `swift` , red is for `obejctiveC`, green is for `java` and orange is for `kotlin` language. 

To separate swift/obejctiveC and java/kotlin bar I used 
`.position(by: .value("position", dDatum.platform.rawValue))`

You can customize if depend on your usage.
